ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Got some cool maths tricks which can help devs write efficient algorithms? Or perhaps you have noticed an issue or wrong information? 
Well, no body is perfect so any contributions are welcome. 

I started this repo so that to have a place to refer to when having certain memory hungry tasks such as working with computations which require huge amount of data.
Furthermore, Since maths have lots of proven threorems & formulas, I think we can take advantage of such knowledge to write high performance code so I welcome 
contributions which will help us learn more about those great theoreams and see if we can apply to our daily Software Engineering jobs. 

This is the very beginning of the project and I will be adding more contents during my free time after work or on weekends, so I am really looking forward
to your contributions, feel free to submit a PR. 

## How to submit a PR? 
- Fork a repo, If you are new more details can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
- Create a branch with initials of your name then a feature you are contributing eg: `mc-geometric-sum`.
- If your sample code  is in Swift language then add your contents direct to the `README.md` file located in the root folder with title, explanations,
sample implementation code and sample unit tests to verify your implementations and the performance of your algorithms. Include Swift playground
with unit tested code. Please refer to the current [ArithmeticSequence](ArithmeticSequence.playground) playground.
- If your sample codes are in any other languages then create a new readme file with the name of a maths technic/theorem for example to submit solutions/implementations
  written in Python for ArithmeticSum file names should be `PythonArithmeticSum.md`, `PythonArithmeticSum.py` etc and for Javascript `JavascriptArithemeticSum.md`,
  `JavascriptArithemeticSum.js` etc. If you can please include unit tests too using the language of your choice.
- To fix typos or any issues on code samples simple edit the relevant file, make some changes then make a PR. 
- To suggest ideas for things like files organization etc. please create an issue or start a discussion.
